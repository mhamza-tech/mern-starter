    text: Why do some people get offended when someone hands them a breath mint?
    Newsfeed: "Do people get offended when they're offered a {{object_name}}? {{user_name}} is **finding out.**"

  .Not sure, seems OK:
    next state: badbreath
    text: So let's say you're talking to someone and suddenly they press a breath mint in your hand. Could they be telling you that you have bad breath?
    Newsfeed: During a casual conversation, someone just **gave** a {{ user_name }} a {{object_name}}.
badbreath:
  .Are they?:
    nextstate: well
    text: Yes, probably, right? It's hard to smell your own breath.
    Newsfeed: Even though it was meant to be helpful, **giving** {{user_name}} a {{object_name}} has made {{user_name}} self-concious. 
well:
  .Like for example, now?:
    next state: ok
    text: Of course my breath doesn't smell bad! Although come to think of it, my cheeseburger at lunch had red onions on it. 
    Newsfeed: After a cheeseburger with onions, you're **gonna need** a {{object_name}}.
ok:
  .Red onions, eh?:
    next state: ok2
    text: Hm, you may be on to something here. Go ahead and give me the mint. What flavors do you have?
    Newsfeed:
ok2: 
  .Burrito flavor:
    next state: ok3
    text: Burrito flavor? Are you kidding?
    Newsfeed: Ever **had** a burrito flavored {{object_name}}?
ok3:
  .Okay, asphalt flavor?:
    next state: ok4
    text: NO!
    Newsfeed:
ok4: 
  .Picky! Chilean Sea Bass?:
    next state: ok5
    text: I don't understand what is happening.
    newsfeed: What is your favorite fish? Think about **making it** into a {{object_name}}!
ok5:
  .Do you want mint flavor?:
    next state: end
    text: Fine. Here's a spearmint mint. Wait, that's redundant! So is peppermint. Have cinnamon!
    newsfeed: If you see {{user_name}} around, give their breath a **sniff**. SPICY! Thanks, {{object_name}}.
