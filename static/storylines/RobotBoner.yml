start:
  .Want to check it out?:
    nextstate: um
    text: There is a robot in front of you. You can't help but notice that this robot has an erection. 
    Newsfeed: There's a {{object_name}} in Unreal, want to **check it out**?
um:
  .Excuse me, what?:
    next state: what
    text: Yep, this robot has a boner. What would you like to do?
    Newsfeed: "{{user_name}} **is face to face** with a {{object_name}}."
what:
  .Probably nothing?:
    next state: what2
    text: You aren't the least bit curious? 
    Newsfeed: "{{user_name}} says that they aren't the least bit **curious about** the {{object_name}}."  
what2:
  .Not really.:
    next state: what3
    text: Oh come on. Don't you kind of want to hold a fully erect robot boner? When's the next time you could do that?
    Newsfeed: Have you ever **touched** a {{object_name}}? {{user_name}} is getting closer to it.
what3:
  .Never, I hope?:
    next state: what4
    text: The robot is now talking to you, and says in his flat staccato robot voice, "would you like me to open my missile silo if you know what I mean." 
    Newsfeed: The {{object_name}} is extremely **flirtatious**.
what4:
  .No thank you!:
    next state: what5
    text: He presses a button and several metal shields around the hard metal robot erection retract into the robot's body. The boner itself looks like a missile.
    Newsfeed: The {{object_name}} is being **unsheathed** for {{user_name}}. Lucky devil!
what5:
  .That's some missile:
    next state: what6
    text: The robot says "Commencing explosive containment procedures, because you are the bomb."
    Newsfeed: Robot pickup lines are NOT smooth. Unlike the {{object_name}} which is smooth, shiny, and **ready for takeoff.**
what6:
  .Oh boy:
    next state: what7
    text: The robot keeps going, "If you were a gyroscope, I would apply external torque to change your orientation to a Robophiliac."
    Newsfeed: It's a thin line between jokes and harrassment. And the {{object_name}} just **crossed** it with {{user_name}}.
what7:
  .Robophilia is not a thing:
    next state: what8
    text: How about this one, I hope you like accellerometers because I'm going to rock your world. Is that more plausible?
    Newsfeed: The {{object_name}} **has some pretty weak pickup lines**.
what8:
  .Sure, that's better:
    next state: what9     
    text: You say to the robot, "I've got one for you. What do you call a robot with a boner who won't leave you alone? R2\#\metoo!"
    Newsfeed: Ooh, {{user_name}} just **pulled the MeToo card** on the {{object_name}}.
what9:
  .Good one!:
    next state: what10
    text: The Robot Boner starts to wilt. But wait, is that WD-40 on your shoe? Oh gross.
    Newsfeed: The {{object_name}} just did a **nut-and-bolt.**
what10:
  .Can I leave now?:
    next state: end
    text: Of course you can. You probably need to go to the decontamination room. W-2 is tough to get off. 
    Newsfeed: "{{user_name}} is **headed to the showers** after that messy encounter with the {{object_name}}."
