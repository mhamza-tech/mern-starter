start:
  .Let's begin:
    text: Wine in a can is a genius invention. For one, aluminum is pool-safe, unlike bottles. Also, cans fit perfectly in the cupholders in your car.
    Newsfeed: "{{user_name}} is **opening** some {{object_name}}."
    next state: sip
sip:
  .Take a sip:
    text: The label on this can of wine reads "Basic Bitch Chardonnay." It's oaky, and sweet, like a freshly cut oak 2x4 covered in strawberry jam.
    Newsfeed: "{{user_name}} doesn't **have** fancy wine tasting vocabulary. {{object_name}} doesn't need it. So it all works out."
    next state: sophisticated
sophisticated:
  .Another slug?:
    text: Some people think wine in a bottle is sophisticated and fancy, and that wine in a can is tacky. They're idiots. Wine in a can is classy AF.

    text: It's time to open a second can of this Basic Bitch Chardonnay. Pop that tab and give it a chug!
    Newsfeed: If one can of {{object_name}} is good, then two is twice as good. {{user_name}} is **getting exponential**.
    next state: straw 
    entryId: 6U4L1BcUhPtKaUlCcb5ycU
straw:
  .So refreshing:
    text: You know, you wouldn't get lipstick all over the can if you used a straw. Go get a straw.
    Newsfeed: It's not sophisticated to **drink** {{object_name}} straight out of the can. Use a straw to let people know you are elegant.
