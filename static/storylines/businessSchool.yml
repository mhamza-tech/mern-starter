  .It's the first day of school!:
    text: 'Welcome to the MBA program at the Unreal Business School.'
    Newsfeed: "{{user_name}} **just enrolled** in an 18-month MBA program at the Unreal {{object_name}}."

biz:
  .Which classes should I take?:
    text: 'Unreal Accounting 101 is a must. We use Base 16. You are going to love it.'

    next state: biz2 
biz2:
  .What else?:
    text: Fundamentals in Managerial Accounting.
    next state: biz3
biz3:
  .That sounds boring:
    text: You think that's boring, how about Game Theory for Business Strategy?
    newsfeed: I want to **get an MBA** wherever Willy Wonka went to {{object_name}}.
    next state: biz4
biz4:
  .Is that real?:
    text: Sure! Apply game mechanics to business. It's the worst part of game design and the worst part of business, together at last.  
    next state: biz5
biz5:
  .Gross:
    text: In Unreal, we have many existing businesses that, frankly, are terribly mismanaged.

  .Like what?:
    text: The Build A Superhero workshop doesn't even charge, and they are handing robot jet propulsion packs out like candy.
    next state: biz7
biz7:
  .That sounds expensive:
    text: And whenever someone drinks tequila with Pepe the Chihuahua, and goes to Mexico with him, that's a $400 plane ticket that Unreal pays.
    next state: biz8
biz8:
  .Not fiscally responsible:
    text: Great observation! We are not managing our costs AT ALL. We want you to manage our profit and loss statements.

  .What about new businesses?:
    text: We are way behind the other worlds when it comes to innovation. Like, OZ has ruby slippers. They can license those, it's Intellectual Property. Unreal does not even have a single shoe store, much less any IP.
    newsfeed: Other imaginary words are **so dull**. Like, Westeros and Oz don't have a {{object_name}}.
