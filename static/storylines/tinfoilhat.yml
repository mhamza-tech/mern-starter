  entryId: 1RVcRxvzIZyNEWSkBZyj2z

start:
  .This is a real nice hat:
    next state: tin1
    text:  This tin foil hat is fairly straightforward. It's several sheets of foil, molded to fit a human head.
    Newsfeed: Just a run-of-the-mill {{object_name}}, that all the conspiracy theorists, including {{user_name}}. It **stops** the alien transmissions from getting to your brain.
tin1:
  .Do you hear that?:
    next state: tin2
    text: You are hearing a high-frequency buzz. An alien dispatch? Put on the hat!
    Newsfeed: "{{user_name}} is positive that aliens are trying to **make contact**. The {{object_name}} is the only defense."
tin2:
  .Hat is on, buzzing gone:
    next state: tin3
    text: It's quiet inside the Tin Foil hat. The alien messages are subdued. But you still hear something.
    Newsfeed: The alien messages aimed at {{user_name}} are being **intercepted** by the {{object_name}}.
tin3:
  .Now you can think:
    next state: tin4
    text: Inside the Tin Foil Hat, it's just you and your thoughts. And a faint voice saying something about an anal probe.
    Newsfeed: The {{object_name}} is **working** for the most part, but {{user_name}} is hearing something about an anal probe.
tin4:
  .Anal probe?:
    next state: tin5
    text: The voice talking about the anal probe gets louder and more insistent. You feel a sharp pain in your butthole. Run!
    Newsfeed: "{{user_name}} is **trying not to get** an anal probe, despite wearing a {{object_name}}."
tin5:
  .Keep running:
    next state: tin6
    text: "You are running through the middle of town screaming 'don't probe me, you goddamn aliens'."
    Newsfeed: "{{user_name}} is **running away** from the aliens, still wearing the {{object_name}}."    
tin6:
  .PLEASE STOP ALIENS!:
    next state: end
    text: The aliens have stopped chasing you. For now. 
    Newsfeed: Just because the {{object_name}} didn't **protect** {{user_name}} from everything, doesn't mean you shouldn't try it.
end:
