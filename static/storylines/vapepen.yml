start:
  .Take this vape pen:
    next state: vaping
    text: Vape pens hold THC cartridges, or nicotine cartridges, or death fungus, whatever floats your boat. Want to puff one? 
    newsfeed: "{{user_name}} is **deciding** between nicotine and THC for the {{object_name}}. And respiratory failure, or shortness of breath."
vaping:
  .Sure:
    next state: puff
    text: You take the first puff of the vape pen. This is so much cooler than cigarettes. You GET it. Vapehead 4 lyfe!
    newsfeed: "{{user_name}} is **puffing** the {{object_name}}, feeling cool. And they are still alive! So far." 
Puff:
  .Puff:
    next state: puffAgain
    text: You've taken another small puff of the vape pen. How are your lungs holding up so far? Ready for another?
    newsfeed: "{{user_name}} is **getting cooler by the minute**, hitting the {{object_name}} some more. Giving those lungs a workout."
PuffAgain:
  .Vaping, baby:
    next state: HitIt
    text: You've taken a big puff of the vape pen. Is it THC or nicotine? Are your lungs about to collapse? So far so good!
    newsfeed: "{{user_name}} can't remember if they **loaded** the {{object_name}} with nicotine or THC. But it's certainly loaded with potentially lethal chemicals."
HitIt:
  .Maybe both:
    next state: HitIt2
    text:  You feel wired AND stoned. Hit that baby one more time! There is literally no downside.
    newsfeed: "{{user_name}} is feeling **wired and stoned**, and is still breathing, so this {{object_name}} is obviously fine. Hear that, CDC? " 
HitIt2:
  .Hit that baby one more time!:
    next state: palatable
    text: Let's switch out the cartridge in the vape pen. One of those exotic cartridges that the vape store sells that probably has Vitamin E acetate in it.
    newsfeed: "{{user_name}} **wants** a new {{object_name}} cartridge, one with a fruity flavor and extra Vitamin E acetate." 
palatable:  
  .Yes that's a great idea:
    next state: inhalenew
    text: This new cartridge has a drawing of a hot dog, funnel cake, and a soda on it. Like a state fair! But with more lung scarring.  
    newsfeed: "{{user_name}} is **all about** those custom lung-collapsing cartridges for their {{object_name}}." 
inhalenew:
  .It's Hot Dog flavor!:
    next state: picknnewcart
    text: The new cartridge reminds you of being at the state fair. Your mouth is filled with the taste of hot dogs, or more likely, thickening agents made from hot dogs.
    Newsfeed: "You can't tell {{user_name}} **what to do** with a {{object_name}}. Unshackle yourself from so-called 'health experts' and 'the CDC'."
picknnewcart: 
  .You are now at a state fair:
    next state: end
    text: The vape pen transported you to the Iowa State Fair. Wait a minute, this is a hospital. This is an emergency room! What is lipoid pneumonia?
    newsfeed: "The {{object_name}} **transported {{user_name}}** to the Iowa State Fair, aka, the emergency room."
end:
